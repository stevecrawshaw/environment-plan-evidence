This is a very well-structured and robust script. The use of `asyncio`, `httpx`, and `polars` is excellent, and the logging and checkpointing show great attention to detail.

I've reviewed the code and found one critical logical error, a major performance issue, and a few minor problems.

Here is a breakdown of my findings:

### üö© Critical Issue

1.  **Incorrect Settlement Periods for DST Start**

      * **Problem:** Your `get_settlement_periods` method correctly identifies the "long day" (50 periods) when the clocks go back (`self.dst_end`). However, it does not account for the "short day" when the clocks "spring forward" (`self.dst_start`).
      * **Details:** On `2024-03-31` (the last Sunday in March), the UK springs forward. This day only has **46 settlement periods** (SPs 1-46, as the hour from 1:00-2:00 AM doesn't exist). Your script currently assumes this day has 48 periods.
      * **Impact:** This will cause your script to make requests for `SP 47` and `SP 48` on `2024-03-31`, which do not exist. The API will return 404s for these, which your code will log as warnings, but it's still incorrect and wastes requests.
      * **Solution:** Update `get_settlement_periods` to handle all three cases:

    <!-- end list -->

    ```python
    def get_settlement_periods(self, settlement_date: date) -> List[int]:
        """
        Get settlement periods for a given date.
        - Short days (DST start): 1-46
        - Normal days: 1-48
        - Long days (DST end): 1-50
        """
        if settlement_date == self.dst_start:  # Clocks go forward - short day
            return list(range(1, 47))  # 1-46
        elif settlement_date == self.dst_end:  # Clocks go back - long day
            return list(range(1, 51))  # 1-50
        else:  # Normal day
            return list(range(1, 49))  # 1-48
    ```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Major Problems & Suggestions

1.  **Inefficient Use of `asyncio` (Serial Execution)**

      * **Problem:** You are using an `async` client (`httpx.AsyncClient`) but are not making any concurrent requests. Your code runs serially, one request at a time.
      * **Details:** In your `retrieve_all_data` loop, this pattern:
        ```python
        for settlement_period in settlement_periods:
            ...
            data = await self.make_api_request(...)  # <--- Stops and waits here
            ...
            await asyncio.sleep(self.request_delay)  # <--- Stops and waits here
        ```
        ...means that the script makes one request, waits for it to finish, processes it, and then sleeps. The `asyncio` event loop is not being used for concurrency at all.
      * **Impact:** The script will be **very slow**. You have \~17,564 requests to make (364*48 + 1*46 + 1\*50). At `0.15s` delay *per request* (plus network time), this script will take at least **44 minutes** to run.
      * **Solution (Option A - Keep it Simple & Serial):** If you are happy with this runtime and just want to be server-friendly, you can simplify your code by removing `asyncio` entirely. Use the synchronous `httpx.Client()` and `time.sleep()`. The code would be simpler and achieve the same result.
      * **Solution (Option B - Use True Concurrency):** To actually get the speed benefit of `asyncio`, you need to run requests in parallel, while still respecting rate limits. The best way is with an `asyncio.Semaphore` to limit concurrent requests.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```python
    async def retrieve_all_data(self) -> pl.DataFrame:
        dates = self.generate_date_range()
        all_data_nested = [] # Store results in order
        
        checkpoint_date, checkpoint_period = self.load_checkpoint()
        
        # --- Concurrency setup ---
        semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(10)  # Allow 10 concurrent requests
        tasks = []
        # -------------------------
        
        logger.info(f"Starting data retrieval...")

        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            
            # This wrapper will manage concurrency and rate-limiting
            async def fetch_with_semaphore(settlement_date, settlement_period):
                async with semaphore:
                    # Skip if already processed
                    if self.should_skip_request(settlement_date, settlement_period, 
                                              checkpoint_date, checkpoint_period):
                        return [] # Return empty list, not None
                    
                    data = await self.make_api_request(client, settlement_date, settlement_period)
                    
                    # Rate limiting *after* a request is done
                    await asyncio.sleep(self.request_delay) 
                    
                    return data, settlement_date, settlement_period

            # Create all tasks first
            for settlement_date in dates:
                settlement_periods = self.get_settlement_periods(settlement_date)
                for settlement_period in settlement_periods:
                    tasks.append(fetch_with_semaphore(settlement_date, settlement_period))
            
            # Run tasks and log progress
            total_tasks = len(tasks)
            results = []
            
            for i, f in enumerate(asyncio.as_completed(tasks)):
                result = await f
                
                if result is not None:
                    data, s_date, s_period = result
                    if data:
                        all_data_nested.extend(data)
                    
                    # Save checkpoint every 100 requests
                    if i % 100 == 0:
                        self.save_checkpoint(s_date, s_period)
                        
                if i % 1000 == 0 or i == total_tasks - 1:
                    progress = (i / total_tasks) * 100
                    logger.info(f"Progress: {i}/{total_tasks} ({progress:.1f}%)")

        logger.info(f"Data retrieval complete. Retrieved {len(all_data_nested)} records")
        
        # Flatten the list and proceed with DataFrame creation
        all_data = all_data_nested 
        # ... (rest of your DataFrame creation code) ...
    ```

    *Note: This concurrent logic is more complex. You'll need to adapt the checkpointing logic, but it will be dramatically faster.*

2.  **Flawed Checkpoint Cleanup Logic**

      * **Problem:** The script deletes the checkpoint file (`checkpoint_path.unlink()`) as long as the *CSV write is successful*.
      * **Impact:** Imagine the script runs, but the API request for `2024-12-31 SP48` fails all its retries. `make_api_request` will return `None`. Your loop will log the error and continue. The script will then save a CSV that is **missing data** for that final period. Because the CSV save was successful, `save_to_csv` will **delete the checkpoint file**. If you run the script again, it will not know it missed a period and will not retry.
      * **Solution:** Track failures. Only delete the checkpoint if *all* requests were successful.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```python
    # In retrieve_all_data
    ...
    all_requests_succeeded = True  # Track failures
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        for settlement_date in dates:
            for settlement_period in settlement_periods:
                ...
                data = await self.make_api_request(...)
                if data is None:
                    all_requests_succeeded = False  # Mark as failed
                else:
                    all_data.extend(data)
                ...
    ...
    return df, all_requests_succeeded # Return the flag

    # In save_to_csv
    def save_to_csv(self, df: pl.DataFrame, all_succeeded: bool):
        try:
            df.write_csv(self.output_file)
            logger.info(f"Data saved to {self.output_file}")
            
            # Only clean up checkpoint on 100% success
            if all_succeeded:
                checkpoint_path = Path(self.checkpoint_file)
                if checkpoint_path.exists():
                    checkpoint_path.unlink()
                    logger.info("Checkpoint file removed after successful completion")
            else:
                logger.warning("Data saved, but some requests failed. Checkpoint file retained for retry.")
                
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error saving to CSV: {e}")
            raise

    # In run
    async def run(self):
        ...
        df, all_succeeded = await self.retrieve_all_data()
        if not df.is_empty():
            self.save_to_csv(df, all_succeeded)
        ...
    ```

### üîç Minor Issues & Nitpicks

1.  **Fragile Datetime Parsing:** The format `"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S"` for `halfHourEndTime` is very
    strict. Elexon's API often includes a `Z` (for UTC) at the end (e.g., `...T14:30:00Z`). This strict format will fail to parse that.

      * **Solution:** Let Polars' powerful parser infer the format. It's much more robust.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```python
    df = df.with_columns([
        ...
        # Let Polars handle the format, it's very good at ISO-8601
        pl.col("halfHourEndTime").str.to_datetime() 
    ])
    ```

2.  **Inaccurate Progress Tracking:** Your `total_requests` calculation is slightly off because it doesn't account for the "short day" (it will be fixed by implementing the fix for the critical DST bug).

3.  **Broad Exceptions:** In `load_checkpoint` and `save_checkpoint`, you use `except Exception as e:`. This is fine for a script, but for more robust code, you'd catch specific errors like `FileNotFoundError`, `json.JSONDecodeError`, or `IOError`.

Overall, this is a very strong script. Fixing the DST logic and the checkpoint cleanup will make it production-ready. Deciding on the `asyncio` strategy (serial vs. concurrent) depends on whether you value speed or simplicity more.
