## Regional Environmental Analysis

This repo contains scripts and data for a few tasks:

1. ETL processes to gather, clean and transform energy related data from various sources. and store in a duckdb database which is pushed to Motherduck.
2. Analysis scripts to perform regional environmental analysis using the cleaned data. and create an alalysis report in quarto which is published to quarto - pub. Images are also generated to populate a report.
